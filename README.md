# OCR Forge CLI Documentation üöÄ

## Overview üîç

OCR Forge CLI is a powerful screen capture and text extraction tool that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Large Language Model (LLM) processing. Created by Dewashish Lambore, this Python-based utility allows users to capture screen regions, extract text using Tesseract OCR, and then enhance the results using Groq's LLM capabilities to provide cleaner, more usable text output.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Region-based Screen Capture** üì±: Select specific areas of your screen for targeted text extraction
- **Full Screen Capture** üñ•Ô∏è: Capture and process the entire screen
- **LLM-Enhanced Text Cleaning** üß†: Automatically improve OCR results using Groq's LLM
- **Interactive Follow-up Questions** üí¨: Ask questions about the captured text
- **History Logging** üìö: Save and review past captures
- **Code Highlighting** üîÜ: Properly format and display code blocks in the output
- **Hotkey Integration** ‚å®Ô∏è: Quick activation with keyboard shortcuts

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.6+
- Tesseract OCR installed (`D:\Tesseract\tesseract.exe` by default path)
- Groq API key
- Required Python packages (see Installation)

## Installation üíª

1. Clone or download the OCR Forge CLI repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install mss pillow pytesseract keyboard plyer requests groq rich
   ```
3. Set up your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"  # Linux/macOS
   set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here       # Windows CMD
   $env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"    # Windows PowerShell
   ```
4. Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed. If needed, update the path in the script to match your installation:
   ```python
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"path\to\tesseract.exe"
   ```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Starting the Application

Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

```
python ocrforge.py
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è

- **Ctrl + Print Screen** üì∏: Activate the region selection tool for targeted screen capture
- **Esc** ‚ùå: Exit the application

### Region Selection üñ±Ô∏è

When you press **Ctrl + Print Screen**:
1. Your screen will dim and become semi-transparent
2. Click and drag to select the region you want to capture
3. Release the mouse button to confirm your selection
4. Press **Esc** to cancel the selection

### Follow-up Questions üí¨

After text is captured and processed:
1. The cleaned text will be displayed in your terminal
2. You'll be prompted to ask follow-up questions about the captured text
3. Type your question at the prompt
4. Type `exit` to stop asking follow-up questions

### Viewing History üìú

To view your capture history:

```
python ocrforge.py --history
```

This will display the last 5 captures with their timestamps and cleaned text.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Screen Capture** üì∏: 
   - Either full-screen or region-based using the MSS library
   - Image saved temporarily as PNG

2. **Text Extraction** üîç:
   - Tesseract OCR extracts raw text from the image
   - Raw text is sent to Groq's LLM for processing

3. **LLM Processing** üß†:
   - The Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model cleans and summarizes the text
   - Code blocks are automatically detected and highlighted

4. **User Interaction** üí¨:
   - Follow-up questions are processed by the LLM with the context of the captured text
   - Responses are streamed in real-time

5. **History Management** üìö:
   - Each capture is logged with timestamp, raw text, and cleaned text
   - Log is stored in JSON format in `history_log.json`

## Configuration Options ‚öôÔ∏è

### Change Tesseract Path

Update the following line to match your Tesseract installation:

```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"D:\Tesseract\tesseract.exe"
```

### Change LLM Model

You can modify the Groq model used for processing by updating:

```python
model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
```

Available options include:
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- `llama3-8b-8192`

Adjust the temperature, token count, and other parameters as needed.

### Create your own history_log.json

To protect user privacy, no history_log.json file included in git repository, kindly create one before running the tool in the sam folder as the main.py py. I f you wish to store history somewhere else, specify it in config.py 

## Troubleshooting üîß

### No Text Extracted ‚ùå

If OCR fails to extract text:
- Try selecting a region with clearer text
- Ensure the text is visible and not obscured
- Check that Tesseract is properly installed and configured

### Groq API Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you encounter API errors:
- Verify your API key is correct and properly set
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

### Region Selection Issues üñ±Ô∏è

If region selection doesn't work:
- Try restarting the application
- Ensure tkinter is properly installed
- Try using full-screen capture instead
